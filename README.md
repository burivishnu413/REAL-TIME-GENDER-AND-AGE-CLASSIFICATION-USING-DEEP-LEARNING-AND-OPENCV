# REAL-TIME-GENDER-AND-AGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-AND-OPENCV
## ABSTRACT:
Automatic gender and age classification has become quite relevant in the rise of social media platforms. However, the existing methods have not been completely successful in achieving this. Through this project, an attempt has been made to determine the gender and age based on the frame of the person. This is done by using deep learning, OpenCV which is capable of processing the real-time frames. This frame is given as input and the predicted gender and age are given as output. It is difficult to predict the exact age of a person using one frame due to the facial expressions, lighting, makeup, and so on so for this purpose various age ranges are taken, and the predicted age falls in one of them. The Adience dataset is used as it is a benchmark for face photos and includes various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, etc.
